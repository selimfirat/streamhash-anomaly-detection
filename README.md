# Standard Anomaly Detection Algorithms
This repository contains datasets and algorithms for anomaly detection.

### Prerequisites
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Randomized Hyperparameter Optimization Experiments
```
python random_optimization_experiments.py
```

## Config
The algorithms and dataset are in `config.py`  file. Changing it is enough to add new algorithm or dataset. Also, you can select which algorithms to be ran on which datasets.
